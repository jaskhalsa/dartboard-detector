# dartboard-detector
Created a dartboard detector as part of coursework for Image Processing and Computer Vision.
This repository contains all images and files related to the coursework.

A brief summary of the work is as follows:
- Viola Jones was used to exemplify facial detection
- Viola Jones was then trained on dartboards
- Hough Circle Transform was applied to improve the detector's performance
- ORB brute force detector was also used to compare performance from previous detector and this one which uses feature matching.
